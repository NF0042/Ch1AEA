<p>Chapter 1, Apply Your Knowledge</p>

<p>I am using Visual Studio Code as my text editor to complete this assignment</p>

<p>Chapter 1 provides an overview of webpage design and all of the design elements that must be taken into consideration when creating a webpage. Before you begin coding a website, you must first create a wireframe and site map. Next, you need to consider several design elements, such as graphics, navigation, and color. Finally, you must also plan for accessibility.</p>

<p>After reading Chapter 1, I now understand how to use a text editor to create an HTML. I also know how to use HTML to create a webpage.</p>
